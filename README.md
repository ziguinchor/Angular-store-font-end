##Â Project Description
an application for e-commerce that lets customers see a list of products they can buy, add them to a shopping cart, and then complete the checkout process.

## Start Up
Clone the project and run npm install to start it. Once this is finished, run ng serve. After that, visit http://localhost:4200/.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
